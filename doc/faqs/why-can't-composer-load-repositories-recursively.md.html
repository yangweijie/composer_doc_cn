				<p>You may run into problems when using custom repositories because Composer does
					not load the repositories of your requirements, so you have to redefine those
					repositories in all your <code>composer.json</code> files.</p>
				<p>Before going into details as to why this is like that, you have to understand
					that the main use of custom VCS &amp; package repositories is to temporarily try
					some things, or use a fork of a project until your pull request is merged, etc.
					You should not use them to keep track of private packages. For that you should
					look into <a href="../articles/handling-private-packages-with-satis.md">setting up Satis</a>
					for your company or even for yourself.</p>
				<p>There are three ways the dependency solver could work with custom repositories:</p>
				<ul><li><p>Fetch the repositories of root package, get all the packages from the defined
							repositories, resolve requirements. This is the current state and it works well
							except for the limitation of not loading repositories recursively.</p></li>
					<li><p>Fetch the repositories of root package, while initializing packages from the
							defined repos, initialize recursively all repos found in those packages, and
							their package's packages, etc, then resolve requirements. It could work, but it
							slows down the initialization a lot since VCS repos can each take a few seconds,
							and it could end up in a completely broken state since many versions of a package
							could define the same packages inside a package repository, but with different
							dist/source. There are many many ways this could go wrong.</p></li>
					<li><p>Fetch the repositories of root package, then fetch the repositories of the
							first level dependencies, then fetch the repositories of their dependencies, etc,
							then resolve requirements. This sounds more efficient, but it suffers from the
							same problems than the second solution, because loading the repositories of the
							dependencies is not as easy as it sounds. You need to load all the repos of all
							the potential matches for a requirement, which again might have conflicting
							package definitions.</p></li>
